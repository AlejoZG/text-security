% And especially https://i.stack.imgur.com/aEsuA.png
% Our goal here is to draw a circle using cubic curves, moving clockwise and
% starting from the left side anchor point. If the size of the circle would be 1,
% the starting point would be the at x=0, y=0.5.

% We have 4 anchor points and between each there are 2 control points.
% On each line, our goal is two specify points for the two control points
% between current poistion and next anchor point, and then move to next anchor point.
% First two numbers describe position of first control point, relative
% to the current position we were left off in previous line.
% The second two numbers describe the second "control point" position,
% relative to the position of the first control point. The last two point to
% the actual next anchor point, relative to the second control point.

% Size of the circle is 280.
% Each anchor point is 280/2=140 points apart from previous in both x and y axis.
% First control point is 140*(1-0.552284749831)â‰ƒ63 points from the previous anchor point.
